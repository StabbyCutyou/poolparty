# Pool Party!
Run it with `python3 poolparty.py && echo $?`

All credit for this code goes to Nick Hoffman and Jason Myers. I just added a bunch of obnoxious logging and turn it into more of a demo, but they are the ones who wrote / inspired this snippet.

You're not allowed to use this repo or this code to do anything evil or to be a huge jerk, it's strictly forbidden by the license. By reading this statement, even silently to yourself, you are now bound by it. I decide what evil / being a jerk means, you do not get to decide that. You also bound by that, because you kept reading, but even if you didn't, you'd still be bound by it, because you agreed to the license already by even beginning to read it. Seems unfair, but thats life.
